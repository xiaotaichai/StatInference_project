StatInference_Project Requirement:

Explore and summarize your data with numbers and graphs as appropriate. Are there any problems with your data (e.g. missing values)? Are there any surprises in your data (e.g. outliers)? Visualize your data using ggplot or other R tools. Conduct inference (hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, etc.) to address these questions as appropriate. Explain your results in writing. Possible analysis includes:

1. Hypothesis test for a mean or proportion (to test a claim based on previous research, for example)
2. Hypothesis test for the difference of two means or two proportions (to compare two groups)
3. Confidence intervals to estimate parameters
4. Regression analysis and inference to study the relationship between your variables; include F-tests, t-tests, ANOVA.
5. Model selection and regression diagnostics, where appropriate.
6. Transformations of data, if appropriate
